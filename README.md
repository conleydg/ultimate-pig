Ultimate-pig is an exercise that recreates Pig Solitaire.  The rules to the game are below.  This program has one main class, and then two subclasses.  I have created multiple players based on these classes in order to find which class of player is the most successful in the game.



###The Rules of Pig Solitaire###
In 7 turns, you are attempting to get the highest score possible.

Each turn, you have two choices:

Roll. Roll a six-sided die. If it comes up one, your turn is over and you add nothing to your score. If it comes up two through six, you add that number to your turn total and choose again.
Hold. If you hold, you add the turn total to your score.
